Async-Hooks

This module allows you to create hooks on your own modules that other
developers can use to extend your functionality, or just react to
important state modifications.

There are other modules that provide the same functionality. The biggest
difference is that you can pause processing of the chain of callbacks at
any point and start a asynchronous network request, and resume
processing when that request completes.
